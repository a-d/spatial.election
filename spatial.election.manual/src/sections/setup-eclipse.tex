Setting up a Maven multiple-project hierarchy is not difficult. All it
takes are 6 easy steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Download and install the
  \href{https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/}{Eclipse}-IDE (integrated
  development environment), if you don't have already. You can use the
  standard edition.
\item
  Download and unzip the newest
  \href{https://github.com/a-d/spatial.election/archive/master.zip}{spatial.election}
  files.
\item
  Start Eclipse. \includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{../img/GMXSI1f.png}
\item
  Check whether M2E is installed. It's a plugin for eclipse, providing
  Maven features. Go to \textbf{Help} -\textgreater{} \textbf{Install
  New Software}. Enter the site ``\textbf{M2E -
  !http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases}''. Install
  ``Maven Integration for Eclipse'' if it is not yet installed. Restart
  Eclipse if necessary.
