\subsubsection{Task}\label{task}

The goal of the project is to work with the data of the German federal
election from 2013 and spatial map data of Germany from the Global
Administrative Areas.

\subsubsection{Requirements}\label{requirements}

Find sources for
\begin{itemize}
\item
  detailed results of each state,
\item
  shape files of the constituencies and
\item
  data to combine with the election results
\end{itemize}

Model your data in ER and store the data in PostGIS\\Overlay the
administrative borders of each state and the constituencies\\Visualize
the results of the election on the map

\subsubsection{Result}\label{result}

We built a web based application connecting statistical data with the
results of the federal election based on a PostgreSQL database with a
PostGIS extension. The primary programming language for the backend is
Java, for the frontend it's Javascript.

\subsubsection{Wiki Overview}\label{wiki-overview}

The wiki is meant to give an overview of the application describing
general concepts used in the development and pointing out interesting
features and solution.\\The first part is focussed on the data sources,
the second part deals with the actual implementation.
